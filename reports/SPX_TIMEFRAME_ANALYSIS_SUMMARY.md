1. **Best Overall**: RSI(14), BB(20), Stop Loss ATR(2.0)
   - Average Sharpe: 1.976
   - Works across all 3 timeframes
   - Worst drawdown: -17.3%

2. **Conservative**: RSI(14), BB(30), Stop Loss ATR(3.0)
   - Average Sharpe: 1.735
   - Lower drawdown risk
   - Better for risk-averse traders

3. **Enhanced with SuperTrend**: RSI(14), BB(20), Stop Loss ATR(2.0), SuperTrend enabled
   - Average Sharpe: 1.271
   - Additional confirmation signals
   - Slightly lower performance but more reliable signals

### 3. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**

Parameters with highest impact on performance:

- **Bollinger Band Period** (correlation: +0.232)
  - Optimal range: 20-30 periods
  - Higher values provide more stable signals
  
- **Stop Loss ATR Multiplier** (correlation: +0.232)
  - Optimal range: 2.0-3.0
  - Wider stops improve overall performance

### 4. **Risk Management Insights**

- Average maximum drawdown across all configurations: -13.6%
- Best risk-adjusted strategies maintain drawdowns under -15%
- Monthly timeframes show lower drawdown volatility

## Recommendations

### For Different Trading Styles:

1. **Active Traders (Daily Timeframe)**
   - Use RSI(14), BB(20), Stop Loss ATR(2.0)
   - Expect higher trade frequency (50-200 trades/year)
   - Monitor positions closely due to higher noise

2. **Swing Traders (Weekly Timeframe)**
   - Use RSI(14), BB(30), Stop Loss ATR(2.5)
   - Balanced approach with 20-60 trades/year
   - Good compromise between signal quality and frequency

3. **Position Traders (Monthly Timeframe)**
   - Use RSI(20), BB(25), Stop Loss ATR(3.0)
   - Highest Sharpe ratios with 5-20 trades/year
   - Best for long-term, low-maintenance approach

### Portfolio Construction:

1. **Diversification Across Timeframes**
   - Allocate capital across multiple timeframes
   - Example: 40% Daily, 35% Weekly, 25% Monthly
   - Reduces correlation and smooths returns

2. **Dynamic Position Sizing**
   - Scale positions based on timeframe volatility
   - Larger positions for monthly signals (higher confidence)
   - Smaller positions for daily signals (more noise)

3. **Risk Limits**
   - Maximum 2% risk per trade
   - Total portfolio heat: 6-8%
   - Use ATR-based stops for adaptive risk management

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Requirements:
- Robust data pipeline for multiple timeframes
- Efficient calculation of indicators across timeframes
- Real-time monitoring for daily strategies

### Backtesting Caveats:
- Results based on historical data (2020-2024)
- Include transaction costs (0.1% assumed)
- Consider market regime changes
- Account for slippage in live trading

### Next Steps:
1. Forward test selected configurations with paper trading
2. Implement gradual capital allocation
3. Monitor live performance vs backtest results
4. Adjust parameters quarterly based on market conditions
