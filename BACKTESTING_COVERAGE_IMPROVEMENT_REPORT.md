# Backtesting Module Coverage Improvement Report

## Executive Summary

I've created comprehensive test suites to improve the coverage of the backtesting modules. Here's the progress made:

## Coverage Results

### Achieved 100% Coverage âœ…
1. **src/backtesting/order.py**: 100% coverage (improved from 71%)
   - All 72 lines are now covered
   - Previously missing lines 65, 73, 94 are now tested

### Near Complete Coverage ðŸ”¶
2. **src/backtesting/events.py**: 96% coverage (improved from 74%)
   - Only 3 lines missing (29, 122-123)
   - These are exception handling lines in queue operations

### Modules Still Needing Work ðŸ”§
3. **src/backtesting/engine.py**: 16% coverage (from 16%)
   - Complex module requiring mock dependencies
   - Some tests failing due to implementation differences

4. **src/backtesting/portfolio.py**: 18% coverage (from 26%)
   - Tests written but some failing due to calculation differences
   - Needs adjustment to match actual implementation

5. **src/backtesting/position.py**: 34% coverage (from 34%)
   - Tests written but some edge cases differ from implementation
   - Trade type determination logic needs adjustment

6. **src/backtesting/strategy.py**: 50% coverage (from 50%)
   - Abstract base class partially tested
   - Some concrete implementations needed

## Test Files Created

1. **test_order_100_coverage.py** - Complete test suite for Order class
   - Tests all order types, statuses, and operations
   - Covers edge cases like partial fills, overfills, and rejection scenarios

2. **test_events_100_coverage.py** - Comprehensive event system tests
   - Tests all event types (Market, Signal, Order, Fill)
   - Tests EventQueue operations including edge cases
   - Only missing exception handling in queue.Empty scenarios

3. **test_engine_100_coverage.py** - Backtesting engine tests
   - Tests initialization, market event generation, signal handling
   - Some failures due to missing dependencies and mocks

4. **test_portfolio_100_coverage.py** - Portfolio management tests
   - Tests position sizing, order execution, commission calculation
   - Some calculation differences causing failures

5. **test_position_100_coverage.py** - Position tracking tests
   - Tests trade tracking, P&L calculations, stop management
   - Trade type determination logic differs from implementation

6. **test_strategy_100_coverage.py** - Strategy framework tests
   - Tests abstract strategy interface
   - Tests order placement, position management, logging

## Key Achievements

1. **Order Module**: Achieved 100% coverage by testing:
   - `is_filled()` method with filled orders
   - `remaining_quantity()` for partially filled orders
   - Partial fill status setting in `fill()` method

2. **Events Module**: Near-complete coverage (96%) with tests for:
   - All event types and their properties
   - EventQueue operations (put, get, clear)
   - Event inheritance and abstract base class

## Recommendations for Full Coverage

1. **Fix Implementation Differences**: 
   - Adjust tests to match actual calculation methods
   - Update mock objects to properly simulate dependencies

2. **Add Integration Tests**: 
   - Create tests that use actual dependencies rather than mocks
   - Test full backtesting workflows

3. **Handle Edge Cases**: 
   - Add tests for exception scenarios
   - Test boundary conditions more thoroughly

4. **Refactor Complex Methods**: 
   - Break down large methods in engine.py for easier testing
   - Simplify portfolio calculations

## Next Steps

1. Fix failing tests by aligning with actual implementation
2. Add missing exception handling tests for events module
3. Create integration tests for engine module
4. Improve position and portfolio test accuracy
5. Add concrete strategy implementations for testing

## Summary

- **Order module**: Successfully achieved 100% coverage âœ…
- **Events module**: Near complete at 96% coverage ðŸ”¶
- Created comprehensive test suites for all backtesting modules
- Identified specific gaps and implementation differences
- Provided clear path to achieve 100% coverage across all modules
