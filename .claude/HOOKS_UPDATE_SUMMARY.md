# Claude Code Hooks Configuration Update

## Date: July 17, 2025

### Summary
Updated `.claude/settings.json` to use the new Claude Code hooks format as specified in the official documentation at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks

### Changes Made

1. **Hook Structure Conversion**
   - Replaced individual hook objects with event-based structure
   - Changed from separate hook definitions to grouped event handlers

2. **Event Mappings**
   - `preEditHook` → `PreToolUse` event with matcher "Edit|Write|MultiEdit"
   - `postEditHook` → `PostToolUse` event with matcher "Edit|Write|MultiEdit"
   - `preCommandHook` → `PreToolUse` event with matcher "Bash"
   - `postCommandHook` → `PostToolUse` event with matcher "Bash"
   - `sessionEndHook` → `Stop` event with empty matcher (applies to all)

3. **New Events Added**
   - `Notification`: For coordination messages with telemetry
   - `SubagentStop`: For agent coordination and memory sync

4. **Format Changes**
   - Combined `command` and `args` arrays into single `command` string
   - Added `type: "command"` field for each hook
   - Added appropriate `timeout` values for each hook
   - Removed `alwaysRun` and `outputFormat` fields (not in new format)

### Backup
- Original configuration backed up to: `.claude/settings.json.backup`

### Testing
- JSON syntax validated successfully
- Basic command execution tested
- Hooks remain functional with Claude Flow integration

### Benefits
- Compliant with latest Claude Code documentation
- More flexible event-based architecture
- Better control over which tools trigger which hooks
- Supports advanced features like blocking and output modification
