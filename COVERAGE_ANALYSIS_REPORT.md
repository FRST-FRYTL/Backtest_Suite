## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 hours)
1. Fix all 25 failing tests to establish stable baseline
2. Implement comprehensive portfolio management tests
3. Add ML module foundational tests

### Short-term Goals (1 week)
1. Achieve 60%+ overall coverage
2. Complete backtesting engine testing
3. Add visualization module tests

### Long-term Goals (1 month)
1. Achieve 90%+ overall coverage
2. Implement automated coverage monitoring
3. Add performance and stress testing

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Testing Frameworks
- **Unit Tests**: pytest with comprehensive fixtures
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Property Tests**: Hypothesis-based testing for edge cases

### Coverage Monitoring
- **Automated Reports**: Daily coverage reports
- **Regression Detection**: Coverage decrease alerts
- **Quality Gates**: Minimum 80% coverage for new code

## Resource Requirements

### Immediate (Phase 1)
