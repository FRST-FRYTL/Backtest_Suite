# Coverage Optimization Plan - Path to 100% Functional Coverage

## Current State Analysis
- **Overall Coverage**: 6% (1,395/21,862 statements)
- **Passing Tests**: 10/13 in indicators module
- **Major Issues**: Test expectations don't match actual API implementation

## Strategic Optimization Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Existing Tests (Priority: CRITICAL)
1. **Backtesting Engine Tests**
   - Fix API mismatch: Replace `setup_data_handler()` with actual `run()` method
   - Update test expectations to match actual engine interface
   - Current coverage: 16% → Target: 80%

2. **Strategy Framework Tests**
   - Fix SignalFilter import issues
   - Update strategy builder tests to match actual API
   - Current coverage: 18% → Target: 85%

3. **Portfolio Management Tests**
   - Fix portfolio API expectations
   - Add missing risk management tests
   - Current coverage: 22% → Target: 90%

### Phase 2: Target High-Impact Modules (Priority: HIGH)
1. **Data Management (625 statements)**
   - Focus on DataFetcher (33% → 100%)
   - Complete Cache tests (49% → 100%)
   - Add MultiTimeframe tests (30% → 100%)

2. **Indicators (1,563 statements)**
   - Fix BollingerBands NaN handling
   - Complete RSI edge cases (21% → 100%)
   - Add VWAP full coverage (14% → 100%)

3. **Backtesting Core (1,082 statements)**
   - Events system (74% → 100%)
   - Order management (71% → 100%)
   - Position tracking (34% → 100%)

### Phase 3: ML Components (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. **ML Models (1,447 statements)**
   - Start with basic model tests
   - Focus on prediction functionality
   - Target: 0% → 80%

2. **Feature Engineering (491 statements)**
   - Test feature creation pipeline
   - Validate feature transformations
   - Target: 0% → 90%

### Phase 4: Visualization & Reporting (Priority: LOW)
1. **Reporting (2,432 statements)**
   - Focus on core report generation
   - Test export functionality
   - Target: 15% → 70%

2. **Visualization (2,181 statements)**
   - Test chart generation basics
   - Skip interactive features
   - Target: 0% → 60%

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Test Deduplication
- Identify overlapping test cases
- Merge redundant tests
- Create shared test utilities

### 2. Mock Heavy Components
- Mock external data fetchers
- Stub visualization outputs
- Simulate ML model training

### 3. Parametrized Testing
- Use pytest.mark.parametrize for edge cases
- Test multiple scenarios with single test
- Maximize coverage per test

### 4. Focus on Critical Paths
- Test main execution flows first
- Cover error handling paths
- Skip rarely used features

## Execution Strategy

### Week 1: Foundation (Target: 6% → 25%)
- Fix all existing test files
- Ensure tests match actual API
- Run coverage after each fix

### Week 2: Core Components (Target: 25% → 50%)
- Complete backtesting engine coverage
- Finish data management tests
- Add strategy framework tests

### Week 3: Advanced Features (Target: 50% → 75%)
- Implement ML component tests
- Add performance analysis tests
- Complete indicator coverage

### Week 4: Final Push (Target: 75% → 100%)
- Fill remaining gaps
- Add integration tests
- Optimize test execution time

## Key Success Factors
1. **Fix API mismatches first** - Tests must match actual implementation
2. **Use mocks liberally** - Don't test external dependencies
3. **Focus on functionality** - Skip UI and visualization details
4. **Parallel test execution** - Run tests concurrently
5. **Continuous monitoring** - Check coverage after each test addition

## Monitoring Progress
Run coverage after each test file update:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=json
```

Track progress in coverage.json and adjust strategy as needed.
